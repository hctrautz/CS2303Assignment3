INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM IN THE COMMAND LINE:
The program can be run by first navigating, in terminal, to the folder where you unzipped the contents of the
program and then simply typing the command "make", which will compile the program.
Next, navigate in terminal again to the same folder as before, and use the following
command to run the program: "./ctest".

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE PROGRAM IN ECLIPSE:
First, download the .zip file containing the program. Next open eclipse, click on the header option File in the top left,

 DESCRIPTION:
 Running this program will print out a series of tests, showing that the variations
 of the C Library String functions that I wrote work exactly the same as the original ones.
